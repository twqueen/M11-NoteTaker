# M11- Simple Note Taker

## Description
This application is made for and developed by students of coding bootcamp to generate an app using Express for back-end development as well as deployment on Heroku instead of github pages. This is also a handy application for note taking. It will save your notes in a JSON file with its own unique ID. When you are finished with a note, you may also delete it.

## Installation
Please do `git clone` of this repo and an `npm i` and `node server.js` or `npm start` to start application with localhost or visit the deployed application on Heroku (may be taken down after awhile because I am a poor student who can not pay for this application long term)

## Usage
Deployed application at Heroku:
